The main idea is to simplify management of binary drivers for different browsers.

For now support:

- ChromeDriver
- GeckoDriver
- IEDriver
- PhantomJS
- OperaDriver

Before:
You should download binary chromedriver, unzip it somewhere in you PC and set path to this driver like this:

```
webdriver.Chrome('/home/user/drivers/chromedriver')
```

It's boring!!! Moreover every time the new version of driver released, you should go and repeat all steps again and again.

With webdriver manager, you just need to do two simple steps:

Install manager:

```
pip install webdriver_manager
```

Use with Chrome:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

webdriver.Chrome(ChromeDriverManager().install())
```
Use with FireFox:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from webdriver_manager.firefox import GeckoDriverManager

driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path=GeckoDriverManager().install())
```
If you face error related to github credentials, you need to place github token: (*)

```python
driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path=GeckoDriverManager().install())
```
(*) access_token required to work with Github API more info https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/. You can set **gh_token** using config.ini file see Configuration section below.

Use with Edge:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from webdriver_manager.microsoft import EdgeDriverManager

driver = webdriver.Edge(EdgeDriverManager().install())
```

Use with IE

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from webdriver_manager.microsoft import IEDriverManager

driver = webdriver.Ie(IEDriverManager().install())

```

Use with PhantomJS

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from webdriver_manager.phantom import PhantomJsDriverManager

driver = webdriver.PhantomJS(PhantomJsDriverManager().install())
```

Use with Opera

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from webdriver_manager.opera import OperaDriverManager

options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_argument('allow-elevated-browser')
# Provide the below binary location only if opera browser is installed in a location other than C:/Program Files or C:/Program Files (x86)
options.binary_location = "C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\FOLDERLOCATION\\Opera\\VERSION\\opera.exe" 

driver = webdriver.Opera(executable_path=OperaDriverManager().install(), options=options)

```

== Configuration
Create file **${USER_HOME}/.wdm/config.ini** with such content:

```
[GeckoDriver]
driver_path =
gh_token =
version = latest
offline = False
```
* gh_token - Github access token to solve issues with API rate limit
* driver_path - path to driver that was already downloaded 
* version - by default driver lookup for the latest version of the driver, you can freeze it
* offline - mode that will disable automatic driver lookup. In this case you need either specify exact driver version that is already in cache **${user_home}/.wdm** or set path to the driver using **driver_path** variable.

Same variables can be set for **[ChromeDriver]** and **[EdgeDriver]**

Config example:

```
[ChromeDriver]
driver_path = /home/user/.wdm/chromedriver/2.27/chromedriver
gh_token = ada23fsdfdfsdfdf
version = 2.27
offline = True
```

It will automatically download latest release of chromedriver and set path. Moreover when the new version of the driver
will be released, webdriver manager will download it and update path.

There is also possibility to set same variables via ENV VARIABLES.

Example:

```
GH_TOKEN = "asdasdasdasd"
VERSION = 2.56
```

This will make your test automation more elegant and robust!
